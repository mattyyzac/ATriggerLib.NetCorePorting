# ATrigger .Net Core proting

## [aTrigger](http://atrigger.com) is a simple & powerful tool to do all timing and scheduling tasks in your app at an affordable price: free!

## I did love this task service, and use it a lot. Not only my working stuff, but my toy projects, such as [Zombie Runner](http://zzombierunner.azurewebsites.net/). So, friends, if you need powerful scheduling tasks, you should try this.

## [aTrigger](http://atrigger.com) got some Libraries, such as  PHP, Ruby, and [.Net](http://atrigger.com/docs/wiki/13/library-net). Unfortunately, it didn't suit for .Net Standard. So I create an ATriggerLib.NetCoreProting project to build a .Net Core Library.
